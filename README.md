Nim is a strategy game between two players. This project implements the Nim game between a player and an intelligent computer.

Following are the rules for the Nim game:
- Start by placing counters (coins or toothpicks or something) into 3 piles.
- Player #1 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile. (It's okay to take the whole pile.)
- Player #2 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile.
- Player #1 plays again. (It's okay to choose a different pile this time.)
- Whichever player is forced to take the last counter is the LOSER.
